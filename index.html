      <h3>Does it mean you can read my personal information?</h3>
      <p>
        No. We only route your ad traffic through our servers. We never route
        any of your general web traffic. Your emails, banking information, and
        other personal information never even reach our servers. For more
        information, please refer to our
        <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.
      </p>
      <h3>Does Adblock make my internet slow?</h3>
      <p>
        Of course not, it speeds up your internet because your phone doesn't
        need to download advertisement videos and images.
